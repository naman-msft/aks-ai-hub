## **🎪 SECTION 0: Business Problem & Hook (5 mins)**

### **Screen: Start with app running in browser**
**Opening line:** *"Before we dive into any technical details, let me show you what I built."*

**DEMO - Show the final product first:**
1. **Navigate to http://localhost:5000**
2. **Show the agent selector interface** - point out the clean UI
3. **Click on "AKS Support Assistant"**
4. **Paste a real customer email** (have one ready):
   ```
   Hi Azure Support,
   
   I'm having issues with my AKS cluster. When I try to scale my deployment, I get authentication errors and the pods won't start. I've been trying to debug this for hours.
   
   Can you help me understand what might be wrong?
   
   Thanks,
   Customer
   ```
5. **Hit "Generate Response"** - let it stream
6. **Point out the citations and professional format**

**Key talking points while it generates:**
- "This is querying 7,705 pages of internal AKS documentation"
- "Built in under 20 hours using only GitHub Copilot"
- "No traditional coding required - I'm a PM, not a developer"

### **Switch to Teams thread screenshot (if you have one)**
**Story:** *"This started because our team was spending hours every week answering similar questions. Someone would ask 'How do I troubleshoot X?' and we'd all go searching through different wiki pages, documentation, trying to remember where we saw that solution..."*

**The business impact:**
- Time saved: 2-3 hours per week per person
- Consistency: Same high-quality answers every time
- Knowledge democratization: Junior team members can provide senior-level responses

---

## **🎯 SECTION I: Introduction & Context (3 mins)**

### **Screen: Keep the app visible, but bring up VS Code**
**Share VS Code window showing your project structure**

**Point to files as you talk:**
- app.py - "Flask backend that orchestrates everything"
- aks.py - "Core AI assistant logic"
- prd_agent.py - "PRD writing assistant"
- `frontend/` - "React TypeScript UI"

**Key message:** *"What you're seeing is a complete production-ready system. But here's the amazing part - GitHub Copilot wrote about 90% of this code. I just provided the domain knowledge and business requirements."*

**Switch between app and code:**
- "Professional web interface" (show app)
- "Production-quality backend" (show app.py)
- "All generated with AI assistance" (show copilot suggestions in VS Code)

}
```

**Talking points:**
- "Every single one of these files was scraped and indexed"
- "Customers don't know where to look"
- "Even our team members struggle to find the right information quickly"

```
Hi, my AKS cluster is failing to pull images. Getting ImagePullBackOff errors. How do I fix this?
```

**Email 2** (Complex):
```
We're running a microservices architecture on AKS with 200+ services. We're seeing intermittent DNS resolution failures that cause cascading failures across services. Our monitoring shows timeouts happening roughly every 10 minutes. We've already increased resource limits but the issue persists. This is affecting our production workload serving 1M+ users.
```

**For each email:**
1. **Paste into the app**
2. **Show the parsing** ("Extract Question" button)
3. **Generate response** - let it stream
4. **Point out citations**
5. **Show the terminal logs** (retrieval vs generation phases)

### **Demo 2: PRD Builder Agent**

**Screen: Your app - PRD Agent**

**Example requirement:**
```
We need to implement auto-scaling for AKS node pools based on custom metrics like queue length and response time, not just CPU/memory. This should integrate with our existing monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana) and support multiple scaling policies per application.
```

**Show:**
1. **Input the requirement**
2. **Generate PRD sections**
3. **Export to Word document**
4. **Open the generated Word doc**

### **Behind the Scenes**

**Screen: Terminal with debug output**
```bash
# Show logs with verbose output
export DEBUG=1
python app.py
```
